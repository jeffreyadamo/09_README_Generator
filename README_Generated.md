## Installation

### Please run the following command to install dependencies:


npm i


## Usage

After cloning from GitHub and installing dependencies, run "node app.js" and follow the prompts. Each member has "name", "id", and "email" prompts, but each type of employee will ask additional questions. There is only one manager expected, so a confirmation prompt will be issued if more than one manager is added to the team. Look in the output folder for "team.html" when complete.
