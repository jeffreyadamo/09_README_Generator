## Description

This application utilizes node.js to create a README_Generated.md file using a series of prompts featured in the npm inquirer package. Users' answers will be placed in specified sections on a pre-formated markdown template. This application will save the user time when creating a readme for any project. 

Below is a quick demonstration showing how this app uses the command line interface (CLI) to navigate through the app using the prompts and its showing the subsequent markdown generated:
